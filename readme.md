# Introduction
In this project we used Imdb movie data to gain insights in the movie industry, ultimatley to 
help Microsoft get into the industry. This data contains information regarding the film production budget, gross, genre, runtime, and more.

This notebook answers the following questions using imdb data among a few other data sets.

1. Which studio earned the most revenue in 2018?
**Findings**: Buena Vista studios earned the most, with a worldwide gross nearing $2 billion in 2018! They're definatley doing something right and Microsoft could definatley learn from them.


2. What is the correlation between budget and revenue?
**Findings**: There is generally a positive correlation between budget and gross. As a large company, Microsoft should be able to invest at least $500 million in a film to give it a chance to stand out. It is around that point where the higher budget films can start to see notable ROI, with the exception of a few low budget outliers.


3. Which movies earned the most revenue, what genre was it and what percentage of worldwide gross did their worldwide gross make up
**Findings**: The top 5 highest earning films were Star Wars Ep. VII: The Force Awakens, Avatar, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, and the Titanic. These films acounted for 1.5% of all gross earned

5. has average movie runtime changed over the years?
**Findings**: The data didn't show any correlation in movie runtime from 2010 - 2018, with films consistently staying around 80 to 90 minutes.
